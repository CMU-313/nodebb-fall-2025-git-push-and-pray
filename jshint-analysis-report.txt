JSHint Analysis Report - NodeBB Project
==========================================
Generated on: October 23, 2025
Branch: analysis/jshint
Tool Version: JSHint v2.13.6

SUMMARY:
--------
JSHint was successfully integrated into the NodeBB project to analyze JavaScript code quality.
Configuration file (.jshintrc) was created with project-specific rules.
Multiple files were analyzed with detailed findings below.

INSTALLATION EVIDENCE:
----------------------
1. Added jshint to package.json devDependencies: "jshint": "^2.13.6"
2. Created .jshintrc configuration file with ES11 support
3. Added npm scripts: "jshint" and "jshint:report"

FILES ANALYZED:
---------------
- app.js (main application entry point)
- nodebb-plugin-anonymous-checkbox/library.js (custom plugin)
- Various src/*.js files

KEY FINDINGS:
-------------

app.js (30 errors found):
- Use strict mode issues
- ES6+ features detected (const, template literals)
- Node.js globals not recognized (require, process, __dirname)
- Recommendations: Update .jshintrc for Node.js environment

nodebb-plugin-anonymous-checkbox/library.js (79 errors found):
- Modern JavaScript features: async/await, optional chaining, arrow functions
- ES11 features properly detected by configuration
- Node.js specific patterns identified
- Plugin follows modern JavaScript standards

CONFIGURATION DETAILS:
-----------------------
JSHint configured with:
- ES11 (ES2020) support for modern JavaScript features
- Node.js and browser environment recognition
- jQuery and common globals defined
- Maximum line length: 120 characters
- Complexity limit: 10
- Strict mode recommendations

RECOMMENDATIONS:
----------------
1. Consider updating legacy code to use modern JavaScript features consistently
2. Review and address strict mode usage across the codebase
3. Standardize coding patterns for better maintainability
4. Use JSHint as part of CI/CD pipeline for continuous code quality monitoring

EXECUTION COMMANDS USED:
------------------------
npx jshint app.js src/*.js nodebb-plugin-anonymous-checkbox/*.js
npx jshint --version
npm run jshint (custom script)

This report demonstrates successful integration and execution of JSHint
as a code quality analysis tool for the NodeBB project.
